# IINs

INNs, are a part of a number of different DocTypes,
under the INNs, DINs & FINs, group of notes as detailed in [the DocTypes Repo.](http://github.com/kilasuit/DocTypes)

For more info check out the [InitialInteractionNotes repo](http://github.com/kilasuit/InitialInteractionNotes), the [DevelopingInteractionNotes repo](http://github.com/kilasuit/DevelopingInteractionNotes) & the [FinalInteractionNotes repo](http://github.com/kilasuit/FinalInteractionNotes)

You can find some sample DINs in the [DINs repo](http://github.com/kilasuit/DINs) & some sample FINs in the [FINs repo](http://github.com/kilasuit/FINs)

This repo serves as a public repo of IIN's that Ryan @kilasuit has published and is a continual work in progress as either his research goes on or he adds things for documenting purposes.

## Your Thoughts?

Let me know your thoughts on a single IIN or multiple of them along with others via raising an [IIN Feedback Issue](https://github.com/kilasuit/IINs/issues/new?template=IINFeedback.yml) with your comments, perhaps linking to an IIN you host in a repository like this, or a blog article of your own.

Don't have or want to use GitHub? Then feel free to fill out this [IIN Feedback form](https://forms.office.com/e/ujs0533VUH) and I will look to review & action this feedback once I've decided how I will best tackle reviewing these submissions.

### Presentation Requests

For presentation requests, whether from me or to let me know of one you intend on doing about this or the groups of repos associated with the [DocTypes Repo](http://github.com/kilasuit/DocTypes) - then please fill in this [Presentation Requests form](https://github.com/kilasuit/DocTypes/issues/new?template=presentationRequest.yml) so that we can get this booked in.
