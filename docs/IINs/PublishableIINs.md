## IINs, DINs & FINs that I will not publish here

There are a number of IINs, DINs & FINs that I could publish in this repo however for multiple reasons I am choosing not to at this time and most likely will never do so.

These could be due to sensitivity in the content that they could contain, like for example, when it comes to your health and when dealing with any medication or treatments you may undertake.

That doesn't mean that this process could not be of help to you, just that you may wan tto isolate that type of content to a different medium, and not publish them for the world to see.

## When does an IIN turn into a DIN

There is no fixed rule for this.

However, the key thing for this is to show how your thought process works when you do decide to do the INN -> DIN & then DIN -> FIN transitions.

A rule of thumb, that I would suggest is that a DIN, is usually, something that you would start after you've spent at least a week away from an IIN, particularly if that IIN is related to a specific.
